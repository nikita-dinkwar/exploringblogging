        <p class="bold2" >                  Ladakh has a rich cultural heritage, and that includes its folk music & dance. One of the most famous dance forms in Ladakh is Chham, or the mask dances, which often signify the victory of good over evil.

            The chham is mostly performed by monks in monasteries, which is often accompanied by traditional Tibetan instruments. The other famous dances in Ladakh are lharna, jabro, spao, shondol, chartses & mentok stanmo.
            
            The folk music of Ladakh, which is heavily influenced by Tibetan music, involves religious chanting. These chants are holy recitations of sacred texts, and an example of that is Yang chanting, which is accompanied by resonant drums & low sustained syllables.
            
            The instruments used in the performance of these folk music & dances are daman, surna & piwang.
